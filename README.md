# Multithreading

A certain theater plays one show each night. The theater has multiple box office outlets to sell tickets,
and the box offices sell tickets to clients on a first come, best seat basis. That is, the next client in
line always gets the best available seat. Your program will simulate the box offices and the theater.
You will process a line of clients, determine the next-best available seat for each client, acquire that
particular seat and finally print the ticket.
